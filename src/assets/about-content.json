TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. Our event is called TEDxJNEC, where x = independently organized TED event. At our TEDxJNEC event, TEDTalks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.",
