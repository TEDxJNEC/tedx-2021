            improvement. No matter how hard we try to idealise things, they may
            fall apart. That's life. But one must not take it as a complete
            failure, if you're wise, you can use every scrap, patch yourself up
            and keep going.The theme for TEDxJNEC 2021 is 'KINTSUGI'- it's the
            Japanese art of putting broken pottery pieces back together with
            gold â€” built on the idea that in embracing flaws and imperfections,
            you can create an even stronger, more beautiful piece of art.`;
